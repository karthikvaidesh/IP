The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it alm
ost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP

GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP

GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and

Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,

GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it alm
ost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,

GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and

Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart

Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.

The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,

GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),

If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the

Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the

replica will be created to replace it.

Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

9.4 HADOOP
Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.
9.3.4 Fault Tolerance
It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it alm
ost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and

down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.

Hadoop is an architecture that supports the storage, transformation, and analysis
of very large datasets. Hadoop is part of the Apache software foundation (ASF),
founded in 1999 to support developers release and support open-source software
projects. Many companies have participated in Hadoop’s code base, including Microsoft,
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo!, which has contributed significant work to
the core
If errors are encountered, the client request is considered to have failed, and the
modified region of the file is in an inconsistent state on some or all of the replicas.
Clients are expected to retry pushing data to the replicas and requesting a write at
the primary. If that continues to fail, the client will recontact the master to restart the
entire write request.
The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a
new chunk lease is granted. The master and the chunk replicas record the new
version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

The master maintains a chunk version number that increments whenever a

version number before any clients are given access to the chunk’s primary. If a
replica’s chunkserver is unavailable, it will miss the new version number. When the
chunkserver becomes available, its stale chunk will be detected by the master during
heartbeat communication. The stale chunk will be garbage collected, and a new
replica will be created to replace it.

It is assumed that, among the hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are always
down. To maintain high overall system availability, GFS provides fast recovery and
replication.
Both themaster and the chunkservers are designed to restore their state and restart
very quickly. In fact, GFS does not distinguish between normal termination and failure.
Clients may need to wait briefly for a timeout on an outstanding request. If this
happens, they simply reconnect to the (restarted) server, then retry the request.
Chunks are replicated acrossmultiple chunkservers. Themaster is responsible for
ensuring a sufficient number of replicas are available, and for creating new replicas
when chunkservers fail. Each chunkserver uses checksumming to detect data corruption
within a chunk on read and write requests. When errors are detected, the client
is informed and asked to use a different replica. Next, the master is informed and a
new replica is created. The corrupted replica is then marked for garbage collection.
The master is also replicated for reliability, by duplicating its operation log on
multiple machines. If the master fails, external monitoring restarts it almost immediately.
If its machine or disk fails, a new master is started on a separate machine,
and the DNS tables are updated to map the master’s name to the new machine’s IP
address.
GFS also maintains “shadow” masters to provide read-only access to data when
the primary master is down. This enhances read availability for clients that are not
mutating files, and that don’t mind receiving data that might be slightly out-of-date.
